  Ignore this file if you have a pre-installed binary package.

  [note that there are no `official' binary packages distributed by
   the Cistron Radius developers - but vendors such as RedHat or
   Debian might include them with the Linux distribution]

  It's probably a good idea to first read the general doc/README.

  You will need to:

  o Edit src/conf.h to adjust the paths for the logfiles, if
    you are not happy with the defauls. Which by the way are:
    - logfile in /var/log/radius.log
    - accounting detail files in /var/log/radacct/
    - configuration files in /etc/raddb/.
      Note that if you change this, you need to change the
      RADIUS_DIR setting in "Make.inc" as well or "make install"
      will not work.

  o If you have Ascend gear, adjust ASCEND_CHANNELS_PER_LINE
    in src/conf.h to be correct for your ISDN connection.

  o Go to the src/ directory and copy the right Makefile.whatever
    to "Makefile", then edit it to adjust it to your system.
    Here you can for example turn on PAM or DBM support.
    Read doc/README.makefile for details.

  o Build the binaries, and install them:

       # make
       # make install

  o If you have a Debian system, you might want to install rc.radiusd
    as /etc/init.d/radiusd and install startup symlinks with
    "update-rc.d radiusd defaults".

  o If you have a RedHat system, you might want to install
    redhat/rc.radiusd as /etc/rc.d/init.d/radiusd. Edit it and fix the
    RADIUSD and RADRELAY paths so that they point to /usr/local/sbin,
    then use tksysv or your favorite runlevel editor to start
    it in runlevel 2 or 3.

  o Read the manual page for radiusd(8) and see if you need to
    specify any special options on the command line.

  o Start radiusd, using "/usr/local/sbin/radiusd [options]". If you
    installed the /etc/init.d/radiusd script, you can use
    "/etc/init.d/radiusd start".

  o If you are not using the /etc/init.d/radiusd script, you
    probably want to put something in your startup scripts so
    that the server gets started automatically at bootup.
