#
# naslist	This file contains a list of NASes (Network Access Servers,
#		also known as terminal servers) which we know.
#
#		Description of the fields:
#
#		* The first field is a valid hostname or IP address
#		  for the client. It's matched against the NAS-IP-Address
#		  sent in the radius packets by the client.
#		* The second field (seperated by blanks or tabs) is the 
#		  short name we use in the logfiles for this NAS.
#		  This means /var/log/radacct/<shortname>/detail,
#		  and Sxx:<shortname> in the radwtmp file.
#		* The third field defines what type of device it is. Valid
#		  values are "livingston", "cisco", etc etc.
#		  This is used to find out how to detect simultaneous logins.
#		  Please read doc/README.simul for further information.
#
#		You can use DEFAULT as a catch-all.
