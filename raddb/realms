#
# realms	This file contains a list of realms. When a user logs
#		in with @realm as the last part of the loginname,
#		the realm part is looked up in this file. If found,
#		the request is sent to the listed remote radius server.
#
#		You will also have to set up a DEFAULT entry in the 'users'
#		file to accept responses for that realm.  See doc/README.proxy
#		and the 'users' file for more information.
#
#
#		Description of the fields:
#
#		* The first field is a realm name.
#		  +55512345 matches all users who are calling to
#		   number 55512345, provided that you NAS sends the
#		   Called-Station-Id attribute to the server.
#		  NULL matches users without a realm
#		  DEFAULT matches all realms except the NULL realm
#
#		* The second field is a hostname. Optional is :port to
#		  use a non-standard port. In that case, port is the
#		  authentication port and the accounting port is taken
#		  as port + 1.
#		  If this field is set to LOCAL, the request is processed
#		  locally without sending it to a remote radius server.
#
#		* An extra field with comma-separated options can follow.
#		  Currently defined options:
#		  - nostrip	do not strip @realm from the username
#		  - hints	use username as after "hints" processing
#		  - noauth	do not proxy authentication packets,
#				only process them locally.
#		  - noacct	do not proxy accounting packets,
#				just log them locally.
#		  - trusted	trust all attributes received from the
#				remote server and pass them along to
#				the client (normally, only

# A NULL LOCAL entry can be useful because it sets the server-side
# Realm check attribute to NULL. That way you can explicitly check
# against the NULL realm in the users file.
