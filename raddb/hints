#
# hints		The hints file. Matching can take place with the
#		the Prefix and Suffix attributes, just like in
#		the "users" file, but ONLY on the username.
#
#		Note that the name-value pairs that are set for each
#		entry are _NOT_ passed back to the terminal server.
#		Instead they are added to the information that has
#		been _SENT_ by the terminal server.
#
#		This extra information can be used in the users file to
#		match on. Usually this is done in the DEFAULT entries,
#		of which there can be more than one.
#
#		In addition a matching entry can transform a username
#		for authentication purposes if the "Strip-User-Name"
#		variable is set to Yes in an entry (default is Yes).
#
#		A special non-protocol name-value pair called "Hint"
#		can be set to match on in the "users" file.
#
#		The following is how most ISPs want to setup this stuff.
