WISHLIST:


MEDIUM PRIORITY:
(Might be fixed someday)
o retransmits from the terminal server get proxied with
  a new ID and random_vector. We should check for this! (is this still true?)

LOW PRIORITY:
(we will not fix this in Cistron Radius, use FreeRadius after it gets
 released)
o Allow for a accounting program, that gets all the accounting info on
  its stdin. If it dies radiusd should restart it. This program could send
  info to an SQL database or somesuch.
o Provide a way to define the locations of all files (/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf?)
o Support Connect-Rate
o take out host-order IP addresses
o Write better documentation
o Manual pages for the daemon, utilities and conffiles (some done)
o Fix all FIXME's in the source.

DONE:
o Radius proxy support.
o Max-Simultaneous-Use parameter to avoid double logins.
o Specify a program to be run on succesful login
o Prefix/Suffix support
o Change radutmp format to v2 (see radutmp.h)
o move radutmp to /var/log ?
o Compatibility with radius-2.0
o Support for pidfile
o Configurable logging: both radutmp/radwtmp and details files
o session_id is not numeric but an 8-byte (?) string !
o Detect reboot packet sent by portmaster and clear radutmp / wtmp
o Seperate /etc/raddb/clients into public and private file (secret == secret!)
  Add ts-type field to clients file for checklogin.pl
  Better: return clients to old form (no shortname) and add a new file,
  "nas" or so. Matching on this file is done based on Nas-Ip-Address
  instead of the IP address of the sender. Better if there's a proxy
  in between.
o Allow spaces in usernames (using " or \ to escape)
o Return Proxy-State A/V pairs, in the right order.
o Limit logins based on time/date 
  (for example, Login-Hour = 8-18, Login-Day = 0-5 for business hours)
o Provide a way to turn off new style accounting (switch, conffile?)
o add 'allowall" option to /etc/raddb/realms
o builddbm.c needs to build the database under another name (users.n) and
  rename() the resulting database files into place atomically
o [optimization] files.c:user_find() should keep the dbm database open.
  It should check to see if it got updated every 10 seconds though using stat()
o Fix DBM support:
  - Multiple defaults (done)
  - Fallthrough (hard for not DEFAULT entries)
  - Spaces in username (Using " or \) (done)
o if +55512345 is present in /etc/raddb/realms, check called-station-id
  against it and treat it as a realm if it matches
