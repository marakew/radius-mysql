.SH NAME
naslist \- RADIUS naslist file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fInaslist\fP file resides in the radius database directory,
by default \fI/etc/raddb\fP. It contains a list of RADIUS network access
servers (NASes).
Every line starting with a hash sign
.RB (' # ')
is treated as comment and ignored.
.PP
Each line of the file contains three white-space delimited fields.
.IP client hostname
The NAS hostname. This may be a plain hostname, or a
dotted-quad IP address. An entry called "DEFAULT" does exactly what
you would expect it to do.
.IP shortname
This field declares a short alias for the NAS.
It is used in the \fI/var/log/radwtmp\fP accounting file, and to
build the directory name for the accounting \fIdetail\fP file.
.IP NAStype
Type of NAS (terminalserver). This can be \fIlivingston\fP, \fIcisco\fP,
\fIportslave\fP or \fIother\fP. This is passed to the external \fBcheckrad\fP
program when it is called to detect double logins.
.PP
The
.I naslist
file is read by \fBradiusd\fP on startup only.
