radiusd-cistron (1.6.6) cistron; urgency=medium

  * Fix typo in scripts/rc.radiusd
  * Fix bug in DB2/DB3 code where if running with -b flag but .db
    files weren't present would cause server to crash
  * If .db files not detected at startup, actually disable .db file
    support instead of just *saying* we did that.
    Thanks to "Martin Lathoud" <mlathoud@b2b2c.ca> for allowing
    me access on his machine to debug the DB3 problems.
  * Properly close auxilary dbmfd we opened before re-opening database,
    this should fix the 1.6.5 fd leak.
  * Updated debian/* files (Norbert Veber <nveber@debian.org>)
  * Rewrote radrecv(), split it up using a few helper functions.
    The code is a bit clearer now and it fixes a security bug where
    someone could perhaps crash the server by using 0-length attributes
    within a VSA.
  * A NULL realm (no realm at all) no longer matches DEFAULT in the
    realms file - you have to explicitly add it. This was the
    intended and documented behaviour anyway.
  * Honor '+called_station_id' as a realm in the realms file.
  * dict.c: print filename in warnings/errors

radiusd-cistron (1.6.5) cistron; urgency=low

  * Updated UT_* constants for AIX in src/sysdep.h
  * Don't store framed-ip-address or login-ip-host in radutmp if
    the address is 0.0.0.0 (a CVX always sends both, one set to 0.0.0.0)
  * Plug another small proxy memory leak (Bryan Mawhinney <bryanm@is.co.za>)
  * Clean up BSD password file support again
  * Updated doc/README.cisco (Chris Parker <cparker@starnetusa.net>)
  * Make $INCLUDE in users file relative to radius_dir (Antonio Dias)
  * Add attribute 'Client-IP-Addr' to every incoming request,
    so that we can tell where the request came from. Alan DeKok <aland@ox.org>
  * Moved copyrights and licenses to one file: COPYRIGHT
  * Added copyright notice to every source file
  * Changed sccs_id in all source files to rcs_id
  * Moved common code from radius.c::rad_send_reply and proxy.c::proxy_send
    into one function (radius.c::rad_build_packet) that both functions use.
  * Added support for tagged attributes to dict.c
  * Fixed bug in auth.c wrt decoding of short password attributes.
  * Added Nortel CVX support to checkrad
  * Fixed user file parsing - in "attribute = value" definitions where
    "value" is a symbolic integer value, the "value" was not associated
    with the right "attribute" while looking it up in the dictionary.
  * Increase fixed-length buffers in dictionary code a bit
  * Reply with Reject on authentication requests without username
    since some terminal servers appear to send such packets anyway, and
    think the server is down if they don't get a reply.
  * Updated redhat spec file (Carl Wilhelm Soderstrom)
  * files.c::userparse() didn't set pair->length for PW_TYPE_IPADDRESS
    for any attribute other than PW_FRAMED_IP_ADDRESS!
  * Server now replies to Status-Server inquiries.
  * Reorganized source structure to make it easier for seperate utilities
    (radtest, builddm) to compile. Added pair.c and readusers.c files.
  * Remove special radiusd.dbm target from Makefile. Reorganize DBM support.
  * Use functions from read_users.c in builddm - removes all
    Livingston code - w000! ;)
  * Added syslog support if compiled with -DUSE_SYSLOG.
  * Transformed radtest into radclient, made radtest a shellscript
    wrapper that calls radclient
  * >= and <= didn't work. Reported by Alex Zykov <alexz@tomsknet.ru>
  * Added command line option for name of the "detail" files (-F)
  * Added 'radrelay' program for replication of accounting packets.
  * Fixed fieldcpy() ``parser''. Reported by Alex Zykov <alexz@tomsknet.ru>.
    Because fieldcpy() now processes \r\n\t etc, remove it from radius_xlate.
    Added support for printing \r\n\t to attrprint.c
  * Don't lock radutmp file for extended time while checkrad runs
  * Locking updates to detail file locking
  * Removed Add-Port-To-IP-Address attribute, it's handled in another way now
  * Handle multiple reply attributes of the same type in the same profile-
    duplicates are only suppressed between different profiles/entries.
  * Fixed files.c::presufcmp::PW_SUFFIX. It used strNcpy while
    it actually should use strncpy. Spotted by Danny Braniss.
  * Change "install" in Make.inc to $(INSTALL) and define it per-platform.
    Install the manpages. (suggested by Dan Harkless <cistron@harkless.org>).
  * Add "-v" switch to radzap (suggested by Dan Harkless).
  * Add "-Z" switch to radiusd, prevents logging of passwords for -y
    (suggested by Dan Harkless).
  * Change "duplicate detected" message to actually show _what_ authentication
    packet causes the duplicate
  * Wrote manualpages for radlast,radzap, radwho, radclient, radtest,
    radwatch and raduse. Yes, documentation!
  * Added -P pidfile option to radiusd and radrelay
  * -l now reckognizes "stderr" as well.
  * Fixed Makefiles because some systems don't reckognize install -d
  * Updated checkrad.pl - no need to edit Portmaster settings anymore.
  * Now all programs that use RADUTMP, RADWTMP or RADIUS_DIR can
    configure those paths using the -u, -W and -d switches resp.
  * Added tagged-attribute support by Emile van Bergen
  * Added support for db1, db2 and db3 database libraries.
  * .db databases are kept open as long as possible.
  * Database mode is now 100% compatible with in-memory mode. Duplicate
    user- and DEFAULT entries are allowed and processed in the right order.
  * Updated checkrad.pl - Fixed a bug in cyclades_snmp(). In the original
    code, if user antonio is logged in then any username that is a
    substring of antonio (eg. an, ant, anto etc) will be matched and
    treated like a duplicate login.  (Gonzalo Román <gonzalo@telnet.com.ar>)
  * Make sure calc_acctdigest doesn't overflow receive buffer if
    it 100% full (4096 characters) by using seperately allocated temp buffer
  * Make random_vector() use /dev/urandom on Linux for srand() data
  * Took out vendorpec/vendorcode stuff and just assume for now that
    vendorpecs fit in 16 bits.
  * Include Cistron vendor-specific dictionary
  * Add Cistron-Proxied-To attribute in detail files if the data was proxied
    to another server. If this attribute is found during proxying and it
    matches the host we're going to proxy to, don't proxy. This is to
    prevent multiple servers from proxying the same accounting packets
    to another host if radrelay is used to sync accounting packets
    between multiple radius servers. TODO: use this in radrelay itself
    as well as an additional measure to prevent radrelay loops.
  * Changed the (very!) old Nas-Port-Id to the correct Nas-Port everywhere
    as I found out that RFC2869 uses it for something else (oops)
  * Make Nas-Port comparisons unsigned (John Morrissey <jwm@horde.net>)

  * Add support for DEFAULT entry in naslist file.
  * Updated README and README.simul
  * Added '-C' switch that just checks the configuration
  * Added '-D' switch that turns off DNS queries
  * Fixed several memory leaks esp. in the proxy code (bryanm@peanuts.is.co.za)
  * Fixed a double free() exposed by above fix.
  * If we're proxying to a realm, add the 'Realm' attribute to the
    request, with the value of the realm.
  * Up max. attribute length to 253, as per the RFC
  * Fix vendor-specific print routine in attrprint.c to work when
    one attribute contains multiple VSAs.
  * Increase the buffer size of the log function, so that the
    Exec-Program-Wait logging doesn't cause the child process to silently
    die.
  * Fix check for expired account in shadow file ( >0 --> >=0 )
  * Alan updated README.proxy, Miquel added some more text
  * Added 'trusted' option for the realms file
  * Cleaned up unix_pass(), added sp_lstchg/sp_max logic for Solaris

  * Fix port ranges so that they actually work (reported by Silvester Erdeg)
  * Alignment fixes in output of radwho (esp. for portnumbers > 999)

  * Fix all strcpy(), strcat(), sprintf() and sccanf() calls
    for buffer overflows.
  * Built in compatibility mode for 1.5.4.3 dictionaries
  * If /etc/shells support is compiled in, putting /RADIUSD/ANY/SHELL in
    /etc/shells disables shell checking (like /SENDMAIL/ANY/SHELL).
  * Updated doc/README, added paragraph about FreeRadius
  * Updated sanity check:
    - print correct filename
    - do not complain about VSAs
  * Updated version.c ;)
  * initialize pair->strvalue whenever possible
  * initialize username[0] in files.c, paircmp(), and only copy data into

    Brandon Lee Poyner <poyner@staff.necanet.net>
  * corrected more logging of NAS name/info in auth.c (Brandon)
