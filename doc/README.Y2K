			Cistron Radius and Y2K


   I've checked the source code of radiusd-cistron-1.5.4.3-beta15 and
   radiusd-cistron-1.6.1 for obvious Y2K problems (use of tm_year from
   struct tm for example) and couldn't find any.

   This doesn't mean you can sue me if there happens to be a Y2K problem
   anyway. It does mean that I am pretty sure Cistron Radius will survive
   31-12-1999 -> 01-01-2000 and that our ISP business will run uninterrupted.
